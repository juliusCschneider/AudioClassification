# AudioClassification
Using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify different sounds

I used a subset ot the geronimobasso Huggingface Drone dataset to the train the model and a very small CNN due to the lack of diverse training data and to be able to explore different pos/neg splits and clip lengths. 

I additionally added some of my audiofiles which I used to test how the model would deal with background noise.
